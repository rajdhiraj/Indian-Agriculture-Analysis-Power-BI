# Indian-Agriculture-Analysis-Power-BI
## Overview
This project, part of my Mentorness internship, aims to analyzed Indian agriculture using district-wise and year-wise data. The dataset offers insights into various crops, their areas, production, and yields across districts and years. Using Power BI, we aim to create interactive visualizations that reveal trends, patterns, and disparities, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions for sustainable farming and resource allocation.

## ðŸ“ŒProject Objectives
-  **Data Exploration**: Explored data using Power BI visuals like tables to understand state, district, and yearly data structure.
-  **Major-Crops Analysis**: Analyzing the trends in the cultivation of major crops, including rice, wheat, and pulses, focusing on changes in area, production, and yield
-  **State Analysis**: Analyze state-wise crop cultivation patterns and production levels.
-  **Seasonal Analysis**: Explore seasonal patterns in crop cultivation, considering kharif and rabi seasons.
-  **Fruits and Vegetables Analysis**: Analyze the cultivation trends of fruits, vegetables, and their overall contribution to agricultural practices.

## ðŸ“ŒTools Used
- Power BI for data visualization and interactive dashboards.

## ðŸ“ŒKey Insights
### Major Crop Analysis
- **Key Areas:** Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar dominate rice, wheat, and pulses production.
- **Smaller Cultivation Areas:** Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Kerala have smaller cultivation areas.
- **Crop Yields:** Higher yields are observed in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, while Chhattisgarh has lower yields.
- **Production Trends:**
  - Rice production has risen over the years.
  - Pulses production is lower compared to rice and wheat.
- **Yield Trends:**
  - Pulses show higher yields compared to wheat and rice.

### State Analysis
- **Top 5 States in Production:** Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Haryana.
- **Bottom 5 States in Production:** Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Jharkhand, and Gujarat.

### Seasonal Analysis
- **Kharif Season:**
  - Rice is the most important crop.
  - Sesame and finger millet are minor crops.
- **Rabi Season:**
  - Wheat is the major crop, covering approximately 78% of the total area and contributing around 53% to overall production.
  - Linseed and castor are minor crops.
- **Production Trends:**
  - Kharif crop production consistently exceeds rabi crop production each year.

### Fruits and Vegetables Analysis
- **Top States for Vegetables:** Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal lead in vegetable cultivation over fruits.
- **Minor States for Fruits and Vegetables:** Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.
- **Onion vs. Potatoes:**
  - Karnataka excels in onion cultivation.
  - Telangana and Uttarakhand allocate less land for both onions and potatoes.

### Overall Area Distribution
- Kharif crops occupy 56% of the total area.
- Rabi crops occupy 26% of the total area.
- Pulses occupy 14% of the total area.
- Vegetables and fruits combined occupy 3.5% of the total area.

## Conclusion
This project successfully leveraged Power BI to analyze Indian agriculture data, providing valuable insights into crop cultivation patterns, production levels, and seasonal trends. The interactive dashboard and presentation enabled stakeholders to make informed decisions to promote sustainable agriculture and optimize resource use.
